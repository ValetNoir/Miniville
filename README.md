#### Rules of the game
- Each player or AI starts with a Bakery and a Wheat Field.
- Each turn, the current player rolls a die.
- The result of the die activates cards of the same value.
(Blue cards are activated regardless of whose player turn it is.)
(Green cards are only activated when it's your turn.)
(Red cards are only activated when it's another player's turn and only affect that player.)
- You can also buy a new card if you have enough money.
- The first player to reach 20 coins wins the game.
